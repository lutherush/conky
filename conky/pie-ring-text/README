RINGS+TEXT widgets by Wlourf 

This conky uses two Lua scripts to display rings and text information.
For a better understanding, each script has is own file but they can be join in a single file.

Of course, the Lua scripts are fully customisable. Parameters are explained at the beginning of the scripts.


Before you run it :

Set the paths to the 2 lua scripts in the conkyrc

in Text.lua, set the right interface for your network (line 103):
	text=conky_parse('dl/ul              ${downspeed eth1}/${upspeed eth1}'),

do the same in the Piechart.lua (lines 113 & 114)
and set the maximum dl and ul speeds, here 1000 et 100
	{"dl","downspeedf","eth1",1000,"kb/s"},
	{"ul","upspeedf","eth1",100,"kb/s"},

In pieChart.lua Maybe you will have to change rings for the cpu (lines 139 & 161)
	{"cpu 0","cpu","cpu 0",100,"%"},
	{"cpu 1","cpu","cpu 1",100,"%"},
	

For "disk space" ring, drawing is automatic, the script detect mounted drives.

If you keep the colors, use it with a dark wallpaper ;-)

Enjoy, wlourf
