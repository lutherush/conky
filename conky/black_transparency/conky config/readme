Hello there. Thanks for using my config. I've used some stuff which are not particularly mine - the calendar.sh and the conkyEmail.py and
conkyRhythmbox.py taken from conkycolors.

Starting this config is made very easy.
The things you have to do are:

1) unpack the .tar file, and placing all the files from the folder into ~/.conky_library/blue_sky/   (Ofcourse you may edit this but you'll
also have to edit all the files for it to work) and copy the conky.sh to your home folder (in my case this file is also hidden 
i.e. ".conky.sh"). You have to start conky from this conky.sh file which executes all the files from the .conky_library/blue_sky/ folder.

2) You'll have to make the conkyRhythmbox.py and all the ".sh" files executable. 

3) You'll have to edit the files conkyrc1 and mail by replacing the "YOUR USERNAME" and "YOUR PASSWORD" lines with your own username and 
password. 

4) You'll have to edit conky_weather to match your location 

5) The empty_line file can be disabled from conky.sh. I personally use it to hide the names of some files and launchers leaving only icons
on my desktops. :)

6) To use the last.fm conky you'll have to edit the lines where it says "slavsan" (my user name) with yours. No passwords are needet to be
entered. NB! You'll need w3m to use this conky, so if you don'y have it install it.

7) The quote conky is made optional. If you want to see famous quotes on your desk enable it in conky.sh. I use it from time to time.

8) If you use a light wallpaper you can change the images from the conky_weather, mail and lastfm conkys with their alternatives by just 
replacing the word "white" with "black" in the specified path to the image. 

So much for the conky 

The screenlets Notes themes are in the folder screenlet Notes. Just copy the 2 folders from there and place them in 
/usr/share/screenlets/Notes/themes (if you're with Ubuntu) or wherever your screenlets themes are stored. You might have to change 
permissions of the files for them to work. 

My tint2 config is stored in the tint2 folder. (Can't get more simple than that)

And finally the covergloobus theme is stored in ... oh no... the covergloobus folder. One catch tho... I'm not using the covergloobus from
the repos nor the ppa but the one with the progress bar (from the bzr branch). More details for downloading it 
here http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/11/covergloobus-adds-timer-progress-bar-support/
The theme is named Bitmap2 because it's a mod of the original Bitmap theme. You could name it anyway you want ofcourse.

Oh.. and also I use the trash screenlet with these images http://slavsan.deviantart.com/favourites/#/dm3s7m
Just make your own theme or for this screenlet by using some trash icon you like.

You also need to have the ubuntu font family installed, or just use your own font of choice.

Cheers.
