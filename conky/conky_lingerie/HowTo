hi, and thanks for dowloaded my setup.
most of the credit goes to londonali1010 for the lua script

so, howto:

-conkyfusionrc is the conky config file to put in your ~/.conkyrc
he calls the fusion_rings.lua script.

-fusion_rings.lua goes where you want 
but take care to adjust the path in your conkyrc file (just before TEXT, line 52-53)

-conky_hot.sh & conky_hoy_mini.sh are the scripts pointing in your thumbnail folder, they are called by conkyrc

-gmail.py goes where you want and has to be edit for username & password
but take care to adjust the path in your conkyrc file (line 59)

-thb-round-shdw-pptv-256.phatch is the actionlist script: if you want your thumbnails in perspective, install 'phatch' from repositories , take a look at the website ( http://photobatch.stani.be/ ) to know how to work with this apps, and then, open thb-round-shdw-pptv-256.phatch with phatch to turn your thumbnails the way i did for my setup. the thumbnails folder is called by conky_hot.sh & conky_hot_mini.sh.

-wallpapers from lingerie'adds mod by me

-fonts goes to your ~/.fonts folder or in /usr/share/fonts. don't forget to reload font cache with a 'sudo fc-cache -f -v' in a terminal.

todo:
-adjust the conky variables in the lua script to fit your needs, script is explicit, just edit it and modify as you want.
-adjust path in the conky_hot & conky_hot_mini to point to your thumbnail folder

don't hesitate to mail me if you need to .<arplinuxnet@gmail.com> or contact me on my devart page <http://arpinux.deviantart.com/

enjoy :)
