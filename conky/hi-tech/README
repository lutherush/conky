1) Place the fonts provided inside the folder at the location "/usr/share/fonts/truetype/custom/"
	Then, recreate the cache with the command "sudo fc-cache -fv"

	You should install those 2 scripts in order to use conky Weather and conky e-mail

	b) "sudo apt-get update" then "sudo apt-get install conkyemail conkyforecast"

3) Edit the .conkyForecast.config inside the folder and change "XOAP_PARTNER_ID", "XOAP_LICENCE_KEY" and "LOCALE"
	The Key and the ID you can obtain it by registering at "http://www.weather.com"
	Change the Location ID at the renjiconky_weather too

4) Edit renjiconky_other and replace the --server --username --password with you details about the mailservice you use.
